Google Sheets and Google Docs are both free to use. A Google account is required to log in (if you have a gmail, log in with that). If not, you can create one for free here: https://accounts.google.com/signup/
Since Google Sheets and Docs are web based, you do not need to download any programs. Just go to docs.google.com or sheets.google.com. These can be accessed from mobile phones
